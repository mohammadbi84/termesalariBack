    Chaharmanar neighborhood and later expanded production by adding handlooms, reaching up
    to six looms with twelve female workers in the Sajjadiyeh area. This process continued
    until 1969 using traditional handwoven methods. After that, with great effort, Termeh
    weaving transitioned to machinery while maintaining the same quality as handwoven Termeh.',

    'mission_title' => 'The Mission of Termeh Salari',

    'mission_text' => 'Termeh is a traditional Iranian textile that has been produced in Iran since ancient
    times. Like handwoven carpets, Termeh consists of warp and weft threads, with the weft
    loosely positioned on the back of the fabric. Authentic Iranian Termeh is typically
    crimson or dark red in color and features the iconic paisley or curved cypress motif.
    Today, Termeh fabrics are woven in a wide variety of designs and colors. Products made
    from Termeh include tablecloths (square, runner, and set runners), cushions, prayer rugs,
    wall hangings, bedspreads, backrests, quilts, curtains, upholstery fabrics, luxury books,
    chests, jewelry boxes, ceremonial bags, clothing, bags, shoes, ties, and embroidered
    Termeh table linens. In recent years, due to the delicate weaving process, Termeh fabrics
    and tablecloths are produced exclusively in Yazd province. Termeh Salari of Yazd, with
    over a century of experience and more than 300 diverse designs, is one of the most
    renowned producers of high-quality Termeh in Iran. Our core mission is to preserve the
    heritage of past generations and continue their path by enhancing the quality of this
    traditional fabric, ensuring it remains a source of pride for future generations. Our
    slogan is “Termeh Salari for every Iranian, with excellent quality and fair pricing.”',
